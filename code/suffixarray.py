    A simple suffix array implementation. Allows us to conduct efficient substring searches.
    The prefix of a suffix is an infix!

    In a serious application we'd make use of least common prefixes (LCPs), pay more attention
    to memory usage, and add more lookup/evaluation features.

        Evaluates the given query, doing a "phrase prefix search".  E.g., for a supplied query phrase like
        "to the be", we return documents that contain phrases like "to the bearnaise", "to the best",
        "to the behemoth", and so on. I.e., we require that the query phrase starts on a token boundary in the
        document, but it doesn't necessarily have to end on one.

        The matching documents are ranked according to how many times the query substring occurs in the document,
        and only the "best" matches are returned to the client via the supplied callback function. Ties are
        resolved arbitrarily.

        The client can supply a dictionary of options that controls this query evaluation process: The maximum
        number of documents to return to the client is controlled via the "hit_count" (int) option.

        The callback function supplied by the client will receive a dictionary having the keys "score" (int) and
        "document" (Document).
